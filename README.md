## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### Scoring System
- **Small files (10 lines)**: 1 point per food ⭐
- **Medium files (50 lines)**: 5 points per food ⭐
- **Large files (100+ lines)**: 10 points per food ⭐

### Special Features

1. **Empty Line Pass-Through**
   - Snake moves freely through blank lines without collision
   - Perfect for navigating sparse code files

2. **Code Breaking Effect** 💥
   - When snake hits text characters, the line becomes nearly invisible
   - Line opacity drops to 0.1 for 1 second, then recovers
   - Your code is "broken" temporarily!

3. **Wrap-Around World**
   - Snake wraps around edges of the file
   - Top connects to bottom, left to right

4. **Self-Collision Game Over**
   - Only way to lose is hitting your own snake
   - Text collisions just break the code temporarily

## 🎨 Visual Elements

- **Snake**: Green highlighted blocks with lime borders
- **Food**: ⭐ Yellow star emoji

## 🎮 Tips for Maximum Fun

1. **Try different file types**: Code files, markdown, JSON - each plays differently!
2. **Larger files = higher scores**: Open big files for maximum points
3. **Watch the code break**: Position yourself to hit lines of code
4. **Challenge yourself**: How long can you grow your snake?
